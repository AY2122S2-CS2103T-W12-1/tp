##Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts powered by Java. The user interacts with it using a CLI-like interface, 
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. TAilor tries to simplify the life of teaching assistants by either automating
mundane administrative tasks, or by providing efficient ways to accomplish those tasks.

###Given below are my contributions to the project:

- **Code contributed:** [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=s7manth&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * **Feature**: Implementing mailing commands 
        * **Sub-Feature**: `mail-index` command
            * What it does:
            Allows the user to 
          
            * Justification:

            * Time spent on this (estimate):
      
        * **Sub-Feature**: `mail-x` command
            * What it does:

        * **Sub-Feature**: `mail-all` command
            * What it does:

            * Highlights:

            * Time spent on this (estimate):
    
    * **Feature**: Extending `help` command's functionality 
        * What it does:
        Allows the user to understand the usage of specific commands. In addition to the traditional `help` command
        invoking the user to refer to the user guide, the extended `help` command can be used to refer to the syntax
        and expected usage of the other commands.
      
        * Justification:
        This feature allows the user to look up how each command works without constantly referring to the user
        guide and hence saves time. It was inspired from the `--help` flag that is present in most of the modern day CLI 
        tools.
          
        * Time spent on this (estimate):
        100mins
        
    * **Utility Classes**: `StringBuilderUtil` and `MailUtil`
        * What it does:
        Allows developers in the future to make use of faster string concatenation and bulk appending 

        * Justification:

        * Time spent on this (estimate):
