##Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts powered by Java. The user interacts with it using a CLI-like interface, 
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. TAilor tries to simplify the life of teaching assistants by either automating
mundane administrative tasks, or by providing efficient ways to accomplish those tasks.
