### Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=festivecat&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **Sample Feature 1**: `Count` command
    * What it does:
    Allows users to count the number of contacts according to a given input. Also shows the users
    the list of contacts.
    * Justification:
    This feature improves the product significantly because it can be used to count and view the
    students/contacts that have a certain tag or class assigned to them.
    * Highlights:
    The execution of the "finding according to a given input" will be used to extend 
    the original functionality of the `find` command.
    * Time spent on this (estimate):
    0mins

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Find command (Pull requests [\#nil]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide (UG):
    * Reviewed UG for v1.1, made minor formatting and grammatical changes.
  * Developer Guide (DG):
    * None yet

* **Contribution to team-based tasks**:
  * Made team organisation and repository at the beginning.
  * Transferred half of User Stories into Issues to track.

* **Project management**:
  * Drove team meetings forward, increasing productivity.
  * Upkept a list of deliverables per week, updating it frequently so that everyone
  is on the same page.
