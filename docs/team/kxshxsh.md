## Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. Through TAilor we hope to make most common,
tedious administrative tasks, that Teaching Assistants encounter, easier and more efficient to carry out.

###Summary of Contributions
My contributions to the project can be found below:

* My **Code Contributions** can be found [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kxshxsh&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements Implemented**: 
   1. **Feature #1: Import-csv command** 
      * What it does:
        Allows our user to import a csv file, given the required column headers are present. All student data from the 
        csv file is imported into the TAilor database for further processing.
      * Justification:
        This feature improves the product significantly because it allows user to forgo the tedious task of manually
        entering every student's data into TAilor's database. All they need to do is export the excel file from LumiNUS,
        with all the requested fields, convert to csv and then import with the file path!
      * Highlights:
        
      * Time spent on this (estimate):
        420 mins

   2. **Feature #2: implementing the base for groups**
      * What it does:
        It associates a student with a group (alongside newly-implemented module field) so that students can essentially
        be categorised or placed into tutorial groups. This allows for the same tutor to be able to teach the same
        student under different modules (and thus tutorial groups).
      * Justification:
        This feature allows for further categorization and organization. Especially required for those situations when
        one user tutors more than one (tutorial) group under a module. It is important to ensure that a tutor can view
        filtered lists on the basis of different tutorial groups; this is where this feature merges seamlessly with the
        find command's functionality. 
      * Highlights:
        While I thought the implementation would have been very similar to that of the former "address" attribute, I ran
        into an issue with the UI not working suddenly. Since this was the first feature that I ever implemented, trying
        to fix the GUI issue was quite challenging to narrow down and rectify.
      * Time spent on this (estimate):
        255 mins
      

* **Contribution to the User Guide**: the initial version has been worked on rather equally. Specific section
   details to be added soon!
* **Contributions to the Developer Guide**: to be added soon.
* **Contributions to team-based tasks**:
    - played a role in renaming the product
    - more to be added soon!
6. **Reviewing/mentoring Contributions**: to be added soon
7. **Contributions outside the project team:** to be added soon
