## Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. Through TAilor we hope to make most common, 
tedious administrative tasks, that Teaching Assistants encounter, easier and more efficient to carry out.
