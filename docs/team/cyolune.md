### Project: TAilor

TAilor is a desktop app for managing contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=festivecat&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **Sample Feature 1**: Sample description
    * What it does:
    allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification:
    This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights:
    This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
    * Credits:
    *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
    * Time spent on this (estimate):
    0mins

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide (UG):
    * Reviewed UG for v1.1, made minor formatting and grammatical changes.
  * Developer Guide (DG):
    * None yet

* **Contribution to team-based tasks**:
  * Made team organisation and repository at the beginning.
  * Transferred half of User Stories into Issues to track.

* **Project management**:
  * Drove team meetings forward, increasing productivity.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#nil]()
