### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TailorParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TailorParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramV2.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact list data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `PriorityTaskList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. This diagram is also truncated slightly as it does not show the Task classes.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramV2.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save contact list data, task list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ContactListStorage`, `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Task Manager feature

#### Implementation

This Task Manager feature is implemented with reference to how AddressBook/ContactList was implemented.
Below shows the important classes that were created:

Logic:
* NewTaskCommand (and its parser)
* RemoveTaskCommand (and its parser)

Model:
* DuplicateTaskException
* TaskNotFoundException
* Deadline
* Description
* Task (that uses Deadline and Description like how Person uses Name and Phone)
* ReadOnlyTaskList
* PriorityTaskList

Storage:
* JsonAdaptedTask
* JsonSerializableTaskList
* JsonTaskListStorage
* TaskListStorage

Most of these classes were linked to the respective XYZManager components in a similar way as ContactList.
For example, LogicManager now tries to save to the storage's contact list and task lists:

```
            storage.saveContactList(model.getContactList());
            storage.saveTaskList(model.getTaskList());
```

The following sequence diagram shows how the newTask operation works:

<img src="images/newTask-SequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

The current Task List uses a Priority Queue internally to sort/rank the tasks. Hence, the tasks
are prioritised according to the closeness to the deadline. Ie, a Task with a deadline of 1 March
will be in front of another Task with deadline of 1 December of the same year.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Extendibility**

* Extendibility was heavily considered when implementing this feature. For Instance,
  * A ReadOnlyTaskList was done instead of just a single TaskList class, to allow for multiple versions of a Task List being
    used if desired. Ie perhaps a Task List that is sorted according to a new "Emergency" level instead of just date-time.
  * Deadline and Description classes were used instead of just a String and a LocalDateTime field to make the codebase more
    consistent with one another as seen from Person and its corresponding fields. This also would then allow a consolidated
    parsing and checking via the utilities.

**Aspect: Conformity**

* To allow the entire application to look like it has been coded by one person, the implementation of this task manager
  feature was implemented in a similar way as to how AddressBook/ContactList is implemented, along with its interactions
  with the XYZManagers.
  * An example would be to include a new `TaskListStorage` Interface for the `Storage` Interface to extend from. This
    hence provides the methods and an interface/facade for other parts of the code to perform task list operations on.
  * Another example would be how the Description and Deadlines for a `Task` are represented as individual classes instead
    of a String and a non-wrapped LocalDateTime, respectively. This is similar to how `Person` wraps the individual person
    attributes like Name and Phone. This also allows the Description and Deadline objects to be created separately and
    allow for finer control over the codebase.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedContents`. It extends `Contents` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `contentStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedContent#commit()` — Saves the current content state in its history.
* `VersionedContent#undo()` — Restores the previous content state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone content state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitContent()`, `Model#undoContent()` and `Model#redoContent()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedContent` will be initialized with the initial content state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single content state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the contact list. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitContent()`, causing the modified state of the content after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `contentStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted content state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitContent()`, causing another modified content state to be saved into the `contentStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitContent()`, so the content state will not be saved into the `contentStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoContent()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous content state, and restores the content to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial content state, then there are no previous content states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoContent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoContent()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the content to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `contentStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest contact list state, then there are no undone content states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoContent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the content, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitContent()`, `Model#undoContent()` or `Model#redoContent()`. Thus, the `contentStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitContent()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `contentStateList`, all content states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire content.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
